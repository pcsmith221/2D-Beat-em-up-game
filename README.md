# The Winds of Boriken 2D Beat-em-up game
This repository is used to backup and share all the scripts created during the development of _The Winds of Boriken_, a 2D beat-em-up game inspired by the mythology of the indigenous people of Puerto Rico, the Taino. The game was made in partnership with David Monsegur, an art student at UTSA who created the majority of the assets used in the game.
